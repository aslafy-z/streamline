// metadataImageCDNs are the two artwork hosts internal/metadata hardcodes into
// the poster, backdrop and profile URLs the REST API hands back —
// image.tmdb.org for TMDB, artworks.thetvdb.com for TVDB. Nothing else the SPA
// renders is loaded off-origin, so this is the whole of the img-src relaxation.
//
// Note this is not the /posters proxy, which is same-origin and needs no
// allowance: these are the raw provider URLs the lookup and detail payloads
// carry, which the SPA puts into <img src> unchanged.
const metadataImageCDNs = "https://image.tmdb.org https://artworks.thetvdb.com"

// securityCSP is one policy for the whole app — the SPA shell, the Scalar
// docs page at /api/docs, the poster proxy and the JSON API alike. Measured
// against both bundles in Chrome 147: the docs page needs no relaxation the
// SPA does not already need, so a second policy would buy nothing.
//
// 'unsafe-inline' is confined to style-src, and is unavoidable rather than
// lazy. web/app/index.html carries style="color-scheme: dark", Svelte applies
// further style attributes at runtime (Hero's grid-area, AddButton's --din /
// --dout), and Scalar injects its whole stylesheet from JS. Style *attributes*
// are exempt from hashing unless 'unsafe-hashes' is also set, and the Svelte
// values are computed per element, so no fixed hash set can cover them.
//
// script-src stays 'self'. Do not add 'unsafe-eval' to make a console message
// go away — that message is the policy working. The SPA bundle contains no
// eval and no Function constructor. The Scalar docs bundle contains two, and
// only one of them ever runs:
//
//   - zod v4's memoized JIT-capability probe (util.allowsEval, compiled to
//     `try{let e=Function;return new e(""),!0}catch{return!1}`), which decides
//     whether its object validators may be code-generated. It is the only one
//     that can run, and it is wrapped: refused, it caches false and the page
//     carries on.
//
//     When it runs is zod's business, not this policy's. Re-measured in
//     headless Chrome 147 against this bundle — loading /api/docs, opening the
//     search palette, walking the endpoint list — it never ran: zero eval
//     violations, zero console errors. So a clean console here is not evidence
//     the policy is unenforced; on the same page an induced
//     setTimeout("…") is blocked and logged, as are an off-origin <img> and
//     <script>.
//
//   - zod's Doc.compile (`let t=Function; … return new t(...)`), which is NOT
//     wrapped in a try/catch and would throw outright.
//
// The second is unreachable whichever way the first goes, because zod gates the
// code-generated parser on the probe's cached answer and under this policy that
// answer cannot be true: unrun or refused, Doc.compile is never entered and the
// interpreted parse path runs instead — identical validation results down a path
// nobody can perceive on a docs page. That gating is the whole reason a blocked
// eval would be harmless here, so do not "fix" a console line by granting
// 'unsafe-eval': it would hand the entire app the one primitive this policy
// exists to deny, and it would also switch on an unguarded Function call that
// currently never executes.
//
// img-src carries metadataImageCDNs and font-src carries nothing, and the two
// decisions only look inconsistent. What separates them is whether the browser
// was already talking to the third party before the policy existed.
//
// The SPA binds TMDB and TVDB artwork URLs straight into <img src> — the
// add-movie and add-series pickers, the lookup detail panel, similar titles,
// recommendations, cast portraits and the request decision sheet all render
// remote artwork. Those fetches happen today with or without a CSP, so
// allowlisting the two hosts changes nothing about what leaks; it only stops
// the policy from breaking browse and add outright. And it fails *silently*:
// the SPA's onerror fallback swaps in a placeholder, so a blocked policy shows
// empty film-strip tiles with no error surfaced anywhere but the console.
//
// font-src deliberately omits https://fonts.scalar.com, and that is the
// opposite trade: nothing was talking to it before, and a self-hosted install
// should not announce every visit to its API docs to a third party. There is
// no cost to pay here either, because the request is not merely blocked — it
// is not made. Scalar's default theme declares Inter and JetBrains Mono over
// fourteen woff2 subsets on that CDN, so web/static/js/docs.js turns the
// default font block off (withDefaultFonts: false) and re-declares both
// families over the copies web/static/fonts already ships for the SPA. Same
// faces, same origin, and fourteen fewer console errors to read past when a
// real violation turns up.
//
// That is true of requests, not of bytes: the string fonts.scalar.com still
// appears fourteen times in docs.min.js, in the default theme's stylesheet that
// withDefaultFonts switches off. Nothing injects it, so nothing fetches it — but
// grepping the bundle for the host will find it, and that is not a regression.
//
// So: do not "tighten" img-src back to 'self'. It does not harden anything the
// SPA was not already doing, and it silently guts the add-media flow.

// /auth/login from a plain-http LAN origin — that arrives as origin=[null] and
// csrfGuard refuses it 403, because no Sec-Fetch-Site is emitted off a
// potentially-trustworthy origin and Origin is the entire defence there. Under
// same-origin the identical POST passes the guard. Today's SPA only ever fetches
// with the default cors mode, so no-referrer would not break it yet; it would
// leave a trap that springs on the first form post or sendBeacon, and only on
// plain-http installs. same-origin still fixes what the leak was about: a
// cross-origin request gets no Referer at all, so /register?token=<invite>
// cannot escape, and the instance hostname stays off the TMDB/TVDB/IMDb links
// the UI renders.
